It is a part of the economic policy and represents the most important part of the state's economic policy besides the fiscal policy under the auspices of the government. In the period under consideration, the monetary policy in Slovenia was managed by the Bank of Slovenia. Therefore, the government and the Bank of Slovenia are the most important instances as far as economic policy is concerned. The success of economic development is in their hands. The Bank of Slovenia was established with an act of 25 June 1991. It started implementing its monetary authority after the threemonth moratorium on the implementation of the independence acts of the Slovenian Parliament, on 8 October 1991, when it also introduced the Slovenian currency - tolar. According to the economist Bogomir Kovač, two examples of “management mechanisms” were of key importance for the Slovenian transition. On one hand, this was the political and economic role of the Bank of Slovenia, while on the other hand the managers were important for crisis management and business changes. According to the German example, the Bank of Slovenia quickly achieved a high level of internal professional autonomy and political sovereignty.<span id="ftn164_return"><a class="notelink" title="Lorenčič, Aleksander. Aspects of the Slovenian Economic Transition and the Role of Banks in the Historical Perspective. Analele Universitxatii din Ora…" href="#ftn164"><sup>156</sup></a></span></p><p id="FromDreams-p-108"><span class="numberParagraph">2</span>The period after the attainment of the Slovenian independence was critical for the banks especially because of two reasons: due to the loss of the former Yugoslav markets the companies were no longer capable of repaying the loans, and loans were granted to companies incapable of repaying them. Franjo Štiblar, a Slovenian expert in the financial and monetary system, believes that the loss of markets resulted in recession, while the additional monetary crisis led to illiquidity and even insolvency of certain companies. Other factors that contributed to the banking problems included the financial liberalisation with the increased competition of new banks and free formation of interest rates. In 1992, 13 of 26 banks owning more than 70 percent of all of the banking sector deposits suffered losses. Certain smaller old banks were quickly rehabilitated during the rehabilitation of the infrastructure and basic industries (the state intervention with bonds in exchange for their unrecoverable debts to the banks). However, with the largest old banks the amounts involved were too extensive to allow for the same single intervention of the state. Therefore, the preliminary rehabilitation status officially began in the middle of 1992, while the rehabilitation status started in the beginning of 1993 with the rehabilitation of the new bank managements. The legal basis for the rehabilitation of banks was the Preliminary Rehabilitation, Rehabilitation, Bankruptcy and Liquidation of Banks and Savings Banks Act of 1991.<span id="ftn165_return"><a class="notelink" title="Official Gazette of the Republic of Slovenia, No. 1, 1991-I, 25 June 1991." href="#ftn165"><sup>157</sup></a></span> Then in the end of 1992, the Agency for the Rehabilitation of Banks and Savings Banks was established, which, at the first stage, took over the bad loans of the banks and in return provided them with government guarantee bonds. At the second stage, the ownership of the recovering banks was transferred to the Agency with the intention of ensuring their ability to operate normally. The rehabilitation of banks started with the decision of the Bank of Slovenia on the rehabilitation of the Ljubljanska banka bank in 1993 and Kreditna banka Maribor and Komercialna banka Nova Gorica banks in 1994. Ljubljanska banka and Kreditna banka Maribor came under the control of the Agency for the Rehabilitation of Banks and Savings Banks in 1993, while the Komercialna banka Nova Gorica was merged with the Kreditna banka Maribor in 1995. In 1993, these three banks owned a Slovenian market share in excess of 50 percent, while more than 40 percent of their loans were bad. Thus, the restructuring of the Slovenian banking sector formally started in 1993, simultaneously with the restructuring of the real sector, and ended in the middle of 1997. At that time, at least the rehabilitation of the largest banks was concluded, while the restructuring of the whole banking system continued. Štiblar believes that “the Slovenian model of banking rehabilitation was unique in terms of extent, since until then there had been no examples in the practice of other countries where the rehabilitation would simultaneously encompass more than 50 percent of the banking sector”.<span id="ftn166_return"><a class="notelink" title="Štiblar, Franjo.

The greatest problem was inflation, which was around 550 percent. It decreased in 1991, but the macroeconomic picture worsened and the depressive situation continued. Economic developments in 1991 were marked by a double transition - to an independent state and a market economy, accompanied by a series of upheavals that even the strongest possible economy could not endure without negative consequences: direct and indirect economic damage due to the Yugoslav Army's ten-day aggression on Slovenia, closing of markets in the countries of the former Yugoslavia, interrupted transport and other infrastructural connections with the south, confiscation of assets of Slovenian companies in Serbia and, last but not least, indiscriminate measures of the European Community and the USA against Yugoslavia, which also applied to Slovenian exports. In addition, the harmony of the balance of payments, left behind by the federal government's anti-inflation programme at the end of 1990, was being eliminated.<span id="ftn168_return"><a class="notelink" title="IMAD, Workbook, No. 3, Vol. I, Ljubljana 1992, pp. 3-8." href="#ftn168"><sup>160</sup></a></span> Slovenia's sales to the former Yugoslav republics, which accounted for about 25 percent of total sales in the previous years, fell to just under 10 percent in the last quarter of 1991, while purchases fell from around 20 percent to just over 10 percent of all purchases. In 1992, the closing of markets continued. With the war situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina and the sanctions by the United Nations against Serbia and Montenegro (these three former Yugoslav republics still accounted for 3.5 percent of all sales of the Slovenian economy in the last quarter of 1991), only the Croatian and Macedonian markets remained accessible. In the short and long terms, Slovenia thus had no other alternative but to focus on real international trade. Rapid decline in economic activity and high inflation were the basic characteristics of economic trends in 1991 as well.<span id="ftn169_return"><a class="notelink" title="Bank of Slovenia, Annual Report for 1991, p. 3." href="#ftn169"><sup>161</sup></a></span> After four consecutive years of declining economic activity, the Slovenian economy went into a real depression in 1991.

The general economic situation was still depressed in 1992, but there were signs of improvement in some economic activities. Between 1991 and mid-1992, the structural reforms and the legal bases for the transition to a market economy came halfway. The fiscal reform was carried out, the banking and foreign exchange systems were set up, the privatization of apartments was almost completed; the laws on denationalization and privatization of cooperatives were adopted as well as the legislation that regulated the operation of social activities and introduced the pluralism of ownership, management and financing. Restrictions on the functioning of the market mechanism were removed in a number of areas. The system of economic relations with foreign countries was liberalized, mainly through the abolition of quantitative import restrictions and the gradual reduction of customs protection.<span id="ftn171_return"><a class="notelink" title="IMAD, Workbook, No. 2, Vol. I, Ljubljana 1992, pp. 3-8." href="#ftn171"><sup>163</sup></a></span> The course of economic developments in Slovenia in 1992 was largely shaped by the consequences of the constant contraction of sales markets and the simultaneous establishment of the macroeconomic stability. The effects of the former are expressed by a 7.5 percent drop in the gross domestic product and an average unemployment rate of around 11 percent, while the consequences of the latter show as a decline in inflation from 247 percent in December 1991 to just over 90 percent in December 1992 and as an increase in foreign exchange reserves from $ 365 million at the end of 1991 to at least $ 1.3 billion at the end of 1992. The central aim of the economic policy in 1992 was macroeconomic stabilization. In the given situation, the only sensible (and as it turned out a relatively successful) approach was a gradual stabilization approach with a restrictive monetary policy and a system of a floating tolar exchange rate. Fiscal policy supported such an orientation by taking care of the global balance between public revenues and expenditures, so there was no danger that public sector deficits would be covered by printing money. In addition, the government pursued a restrictive pricing policy in monopolistic activities and gradually reduced the cost of imports by reducing import duty rates. The monthly inflation rate fell from 21.5 percent in October 1991 to 1.4 percent in August 1992. The stabilization policy had two inevitable consequences, which usually occur during the implementation of any successful stabilization programme - a fall in the real exchange rate of foreign currencies and a rise in market real interest rates, which reached an extremely high level in the critical financial situation of commercial banks and companies, as they also included a high default risk premium. At the end of June 1992, the Bank of Slovenia and the government therefore began to influence the developments in the foreign exchange and money markets through coordinated market-oriented measures; the result after three months was that the real exchange rate of the basket of foreign currencies rose by 11 percent, and the real interest rate on the interbank money market fell from about 30 percent to 18 percent. As an obstacle to the implementation of the stabilization and development policies, a sharp rise in real wages in the economy and consequently in the non-economy occurred in 1992. In the second half of the year, the government managed to maintain wages in the public sector at the same level and in the companies where it directly or indirectly participated in the restructuring.<span id="ftn172_return"><a class="notelink" title="IMAD, Workbook, No. 9, Vol. I, Ljubljana 1992, p. 2." href="#ftn172"><sup>164</sup></a></span> It began the implementation of the existing collective agreements for the economy and individual economic activities, which were known to set minimum rights at a level that was difficult to achieve for the majority of the economy. In the non-economy, there were two collective agreements in force with unrealistically determined wages in relation to the available funds in the national budget. At the same time, an intervention law was in force which was to regulate wages until the end of March 1992.<span id="ftn173_return"><a class="notelink" title="Štoka Debevec, Meta.

These phenomena were interrelated and partly the result of delays in the privatization of socially-owned companies and, last but not least, a moratorium on bankruptcies. Part of the losses was thus certainly inflated, which, given the large dimension of the problem, did not diminish the weight of the fact that at that time the state was actually living off the sale of its property. In July 1992, the government began implementing the project of restructuring the Slovenian economy, but otherwise there were virtually no laws passed in the economic field that would reduce the already obvious lag behind its own goals. The Agency for the Rehabilitation of Banks began the initial phase of the bank rehabilitation process in mid-1992.<span id="ftn174_return"><a class="notelink" title="IMAD, Workbook, No. 9, Vol. I, Ljubljana 1992, pp. 1-3." href="#ftn174"><sup>166</sup></a></span> Some significant economic developments in the last quarter of 1992 could be understood as first signs of improvement. However, as the economy was just entering a crucial period of transition to a modern market economy, this, of course, could not be a cause for joy, especially because the essential economic and political gaps were widening. What we have in mind are the collective agreements and the relevant law, as they were completely uncoordinated and, above all, calibrated at significantly more favourable economic performance than the actual one, thus preventing the stabilization of a key national economic cost in the short term. The state's conduct was also a problem, as the social part of the public sector became too “inflated”, while the “budding” of new funds rapidly reduced the control of economic policy and parliament over revenues and spending of the relevant part of the public sector. The task of economic policy-makers at that time was mainly to significantly tighten the monetary, fiscal and income policies and financially control the public sector operations.<span id="ftn175_return"><a class="notelink" title="Gospodarska gibanja (GG) [Economic Trends], No. 234, 1992/12, Institute of Economics, Faculty of Law, Ljubljana, pp. 25-43." href="#ftn175"><sup>167</sup></a></span> At the end of 1992, Dr. Jože Mencinger wrote the following about the work of Drnovšek's government: “The government has little to do with reducing inflation, nothing to do with stopping production and neither with the export surplus”. He also said that “for most of what has been happening in the economy in the past eight months, the economic policy of Drnovšek's government is neither to blame nor deserving a praise”. Mencinger also touched on the privatization law, which, according to him, was not something to be proud of, and he believed that it had been adopted “completely unexpectedly by a completely unpredictable parliament”.<span id="ftn176_return"><a class="notelink" title="Mencinger, Jože.

Higher than expected by those who had hoped for some miracle effects from the introduction of the market economy and independence from Belgrade, and perhaps somewhat more modest than some experts on the economy feared. Jože Mencinger said about the transition from a socialist to a market economy that it began with the illusion that the introduction of the market would immediately or at least quickly transform the former socialist economies into welfare states. These illusions were shared by new political elites on the one hand and international financial institutions and Western experts on the other. Three years after the beginning of the transformation, the illusions turned out to truly be illusions, and the excessive optimism turned into excessive pessimism and hopelessness.<span id="ftn177_return"><a class="notelink" title="Krašovec, Deset let gospodarskega razvoja [Ten Years of Economic Development], p. 13." href="#ftn177"><sup>169</sup></a></span></p></div><div class="subchapter" id="ch7.2"><h3><span class="head" itemprop="head" id="FromDreams-head-106">Transformational recovery (1993-1995)</span></h3><p id="FromDreams-p-112"><span class="numberParagraph">1</span>After the initial phase of the transition to a social market economy, which was characterized by the declining economic growth and standard of living, rapid reduction in investment and employment along with significant macroeconomic instability, the Slovenian economy entered a period of transformational recovery. This period, which began in Slovenia in 1993, was marked by intensive restructuring in production and consumption (primary and final division) and dynamic economic growth. Gross domestic product increased by 1.9 percent in 1993, by 4.9 percent in 1994 and by a further 3.5 percent in 1995. Economic strength reached its pre-independence level. Economic developments in 1994 also confirmed the transition to economic growth. Positive trends in industrial production continued and its annual growth was 6.5 percent. In 1994, there was also a revival of construction, which had been declining for a long time. The growth in market services continued. For the first time in two years, we could also observe an increase in agricultural production. Gross domestic product increased by about 5 percent in that year.<span id="ftn178_return"><a class="notelink" title="IMAD, Workbook, No. 10, Vol. III, Ljubljana 1994, pp. 2 -5." href="#ftn178"><sup>170</sup></a></span> Undoubtedly, the grey economy also played a certain role in the transition from recession to recovery as an unregistered economic profit-making activity, operating outside the regulations and evading taxes, with some covert activities also taking place within the units of the “official sector”. All this was mainly due to poorly developed tax control mechanisms, relatively low fines, inadequate organization and remuneration in companies, which did not particularly restrict grey areas, and the unsatisfactory functioning of the legal system. According to some estimates, the share of the grey economy represented 15 to 20 percent of economic activity in Slovenia.<span id="ftn179_return"><a class="notelink" title="Krašovec, Deset let gospodarskega razvoja [Ten Years of Economic Development], pp. 23-24." href="#ftn179"><sup>171</sup></a></span> Just as the main cause of the economic depression in 1991-1992 was a dramatic drop in total demand, the onset of economic recovery in mid-1993 was also associated with a strengthening of overall demand. The latter was made possible by the fact that, in the economic sense, Slovenia had completed one of the phases of transformation, namely from a regional to a national economy.<span id="ftn180_return"><a class="notelink" title="IMAD, Workbook, No. 6, Vol. III, Ljubljana 1994, p. 2." href="#ftn180"><sup>172</sup></a></span> The focus of economic policy in 1993 was on institutional and real restructuring of the economy. The decline in production continued in early 1993, while a significant positive turnaround in a number of industries was recorded in the second half of the year. The turning point was achieved with a relentless monetary policy that continued to reduce current inflation, with balanced government finances and without net external borrowing. Production, especially industrial one, continued to adapt to the effects of reduced demand from the markets of the countries of the former Yugoslavia for the most part of 1993. From 1990 to 1993, the sale of goods and services to this area decreased from 31 percent to about 5 percent of all sales of the Slovenian economy. In 1995, the former Yugoslav market was characterized by the fact that the economies and former markets of Yugoslavia achieved only 10 of the 65 percent of the maximum activity already achieved in the past.

Negotiations for the conclusion of the annual social agreement also took place within the Economic and Social Council. The fact that despite the agreement on wage policy a law was required to implement it was not exactly in favour of the negotiators, but this practice continued in the following years.

Despite mass unemployment, employers were relatively unsuccessful in finding a suitable workforce, especially if the employment was for a fixed term - particularly in agriculture. Thousands of foreign seasonal workers had to be sought annually in such cases.

In the markets of important European partners, the prices of Slovenian exported products were below the average import prices for the same or similar imported products. The structure of Slovenian exports did not change enough and was too concentrated in those product groups where demand was below average. The Slovenian economy was thus sensitive to economic fluctuations in the European markets. In the second half of the 1990s, foreign direct investments in the Slovenian economy were growing in a fluctuating manner year by year. The stock of foreign direct investments rose from about $ 2 billion in 1996 to close to $ 2.8 billion in 2000.<span id="ftn194_return"><a class="notelink" title="Krašovec, Deset let gospodarskega razvoja [Ten Years of Economic Development], pp. 29-31." href="#ftn194"><sup>186</sup></a></span></p><p id="FromDreams-p-114"><span class="numberParagraph">2</span>In 1996-1999, Slovenia recorded a downward trend in inflation.

In the industry, where wage growth was above average, nominal labour cost growth outpaced large savings from increased productivity. Wage growth in 1996 originated mainly from the public sector (real average wages rose by 5.6 percent in the state administration, by 5.5 percent in education and by 6.3 percent in health care), construction (6 percent) and agriculture (5.7 percent), that is, mostly from the fields the conduct of which was only loosely related to the monetary policy and which were not affected by the constraints dictated by exchange rate movements.<span id="ftn196_return"><a class="notelink" title="Bank of Slovenia, Annual Report for 1996, p. 10." href="#ftn196"><sup>188</sup></a></span> The Social Agreement,<span id="ftn197_return"><a class="notelink" title="Official Gazette of the Republic of Slovenia, No. 29, 31 May 1996." href="#ftn197"><sup>189</sup></a></span> finally concluded at the end of May 1996, stipulated that wages were paid in accordance with the collective agreement, but that, according to the escalation scale, only starting wages increase by tariff and pay grades, while basic wages grow only by a difference of identified increases in starting wages.

The gradual rise in prices in 2000 and in the first half of 2001 was largely due to continued rising of oil prices in the global market, which also partly contributed to the slow moderation of price growth in 2001. Among the internal factors that enabled inflation to remain relatively high, it is necessary to point out the comparatively fast rise in regulated prices, frequent changes in the tax area and the focus of monetary policy on regulating exchange rate movements, which, together with increased financial inflows, resulted in increased growth of monetary aggregates. Regarding the inflation problem at that time, the director of the Office for Macroeconomic Analysis and Development said that he “does not understand why the central bank would not at least conditionally define the inflation target, and if it did not achieve it, it could explain exactly which government actions had gotten in the way”.<span id="ftn209_return"><a class="notelink" title="BS lahko naredi več.

However, at the end of 2002, inflation was the highest in Slovenia among the mentioned countries and was at the same time about three times higher than the level determined by the Union's convergence criterion on price stability. With high inflation, economic growth fell in 2000 compared to 1999. It declined even further the following year, reaching only 2.3 percent in 2003. With the decrease in economic growth, employment growth also slowed down. In 2002 in particular, employment growth slowed sharply and the decline in unemployment almost came to a halt. Due to retirements and other deletions from unemployment registers, the share of the long-term unemployed decreased slightly in 2001, from 63% in 2000 to 59 %. With a more intensive focus of the employment policy on the problems of the people at a disadvantage in the labour market and the retirement of older people who met the criteria for retirement, the share was also falling in 2002. The problem of employing uneducated unemployed people persisted, as their share remained at about 47 percent.<span id="ftn210_return"><a class="notelink" title="Javornik, Jana, Korošec, Valerija (eds.).

The state was still strongly and directly present in the economy - the share of the private sector in gross domestic product increased from 30 percent in 1992 to 65 percent in 2000 with the privatization of socially-owned property, but still lagged behind other transition countries. In 2000, the process of privatization also started in the financial sector, where, after a long discussion on the national interest, the state sold a 39% share of Nova ljubljanska banka bank to foreigners.

Economic growth was the highest and inflation the lowest in the new millennium. Economic activity was relatively high in 2004 after several years of rather low growth rates. The average growth rate of gross domestic product was 4.4 percent. Domestic demand also strengthened and industrial production grew by 4.8%. There was a moderate wage growth, mainly due to low wage growth in the public sector. Employment trends were in line with the economic activity, and the number of unemployed was 5% lower than in 2003. The growth in the number of employees in the service sector again outpaced the growth in the industry. The trend of disinflation continued and the average annual inflation rate in 2004 was 3.6 percent. The Bank of Slovenia pursued the goal of achieving price stability. Imports of goods grew faster than exports in 2004. Real growth in exports of goods doubled while real growth in imports increased by half. Slovenia became a member of the European Union on 1 May 2004. Slovenia's accession to the EU and the revival of economic activity in the EU had a favourable effect on trade. On the export side, the exports of reproductive material increased the most, while on the import side, the imports of reproductive material and consumer goods were prevailing. The commodity exchange deficit increased by EUR 337 million. There was also an above-average increase in exports to the countries of the former Soviet Union and Yugoslavia. The share of exports to the countries of the former Yugoslavia rose to 17.9 percent in 2004, and the share of imports to 5.8 percent. Germany, Italy, Austria and France remained the most important trading partners. There was an increase or acceleration of exports to Greece, Belgium, Denmark and Spain. The exports of services increased in general by 13 percent in 2004 and the imports by 10 percent. The revenues from tourism were also growing faster than expenditures. After 1996, transport services were the fastest growing service activity in 2004. The financial outflows of the private sector also increased. The share of investments in foreign securities doubled in the structure of financial outflows. Slovenia's accession to the EU also resulted in higher foreign direct investment. One of the negative consequences, however, was the increased volume of foreign borrowing by the Slovenian banks and companies. The gross external debt also increased. By joining the EU, Slovenia became a member of the Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) with a derogation regarding the introduction of the euro. This means that it did not adopt the euro immediately after joining the EU, but it did so on 1 January 2007. With Slovenia's accession to the EU, the Bank of Slovenia became a member of the European System of Central Banks (ESCB), which consists of the European Central Bank (ECB) and the national central banks of the EU Member States. The representatives of the Bank of Slovenia thus acquired the status of members of the General Council of the ECB, committees and working groups of the ESCB. Due to the planned adoption of the euro, the Bank of Slovenia continued to adjust its monetary policy instruments. The integration into the EU and the planned introduction of the euro also required adjustments in the area of payment systems. In any case, after Slovenia's accession to the EU, the Bank of Slovenia still had to implement quite a few necessary measures and adjustments before the euro was adopted. The Bank of Slovenia therefore played an extremely important role in this regard.<span id="ftn217_return"><a class="notelink" title="Bank of Slovenia, Annual Report for 2004, pp. 9-26." href="#ftn217"><sup>209</sup></a></span></p></div><div class="subchapter" id="ch7.6"><h3><span class="head" itemprop="head" id="FromDreams-head-111">Towards new challenges and crises (from 2004 to the present day)</span></h3><p id="FromDreams-p-120"><span class="numberParagraph">1</span>After 2004, the period of the so-called fat cows began - the time of the boom.</p><p id="FromDreams-p-121"><span class="numberParagraph">2</span>In 2006, Slovenia's economic growth amounted to 5.2 percent, while in the second half of the year even to 5.5 percent. Growth during this period was mainly driven by strong exports, tied to the favourable European economy. In the second half of the year, this picture changed somewhat, as higher domestic consumption, especially investments, was the thing that contributed to the high aggregate growth, when a strong new wave in infrastructure joined the already intensive construction of housing. In construction, real value added increased by over 20 percent and employment by almost 10 percent in the last quarter compared to 2005. High economic growth was also significantly influenced by typical “convergence” factors, such as credit expansion based on external borrowing, etc. As pointed out in the annual report by the Bank of Slovenia for 2006, the growth generated in this manner also included risks.<span id="ftn218_return"><a class="notelink" title="Bank of Slovenia, Annual Report for 2006, p. 9." href="#ftn218"><sup>210</sup></a></span> The economic growth in 2006 was the highest since 1999. Higher domestic demand crucially contributed to high economic activity, which was accelerating in the last quarter of 2005 and gradually increasing during 2006. In the structure of investments, high investments in residential and non-residential buildings stood out the most, and after a negative growth in 2005, investments in transport equipment also increased sharply. On average, household consumption remained almost unchanged in 2006 compared to the previous year, despite improved labour market conditions, growing consumer optimism and more favourable lending conditions. The spending of private non-profit institutions increased in 2006 after two years of negative growth, while state spending also accelerated by 1 percentage point to 3.2 percent compared to the previous year. The interim growth in exports of goods and services slowed slightly in 2006 compared to the previous two years, while the growth in imports of goods and services somewhat accelerated, contributing, among other things, to the increase in the negative balance of payment position in 2006. In line with the high growth of value added in manufacturing in 2006 (7.1 percent), the growth of industrial production was also high (7.6 percent), which slowed down slightly only at the end of the year.<span id="ftn219_return"><a class="notelink" title="Ibid., pp. 12-14." href="#ftn219"><sup>211</sup></a></span></p><p id="FromDreams-p-122"><span class="numberParagraph">3</span>On 1 January 2007, Slovenia adopted the euro as its national currency. The transition and change of currency went smoothly, but in some cases, prices were “rounded” up, especially in services and catering. The impact of the introduction of the euro on inflation was, according to most estimates, around 0.3 percentage points. The positive effects of Slovenia's accession to the European Union continued in 2007. The favourable European and international economic conditions and the consequent high growth of foreign trade enabled 6.1% aggregate real economic growth, which was the highest growth in the post-independence period. The result of high economic growth was a high increase in total employment by 2.7 percent and a decrease in the unemployment rate to 4.6 percent. In addition to exports, high growth in domestic consumption also contributed to high GDP and employment growth. It was driven by a very high growth of investments, especially investments in construction works. After entering the European Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM II) in July 2004, the efficiency of the Bank of Slovenia's monetary control gradually began to decline due to the convergence of domestic interest rates to the level of the European ones, which stimulated strong credit growth. As written by Marko Kranjec, the Governor of the Bank of Slovenia, in the editorial of the Annual Report for 2007, the central bank estimated that economic growth in the second half of 2006 and even more so in 2007 was above the production potentials that ensure macroeconomic balance. With the accession to the European Union, there was a large increase in imports, which, with increasing domestic consumption, began to outpace exports, leading to a large increase in the external deficit. Imports from the countries of the former Yugoslavia were growing faster than exports since Slovenia's accession to the European Union. Trade with Serbia was growing the fastest in 2007. The deficit of the current account of the balance of payments amounted to 4.9 percent of GDP in 2007, which was already a clear and serious sign of macroeconomic imbalances. Wage growth was also increasing throughout 2007, while inflation slowed somewhat in the first months of 2007 but started rising in the middle and especially towards the end of the year and was well above the euro area average. At the end of the year, the Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) increased by 5.7 percent, with the largest part of the increase being caused by external supply shocks, especially increases in food, raw material and energy prices. With the general government surplus, net deleveraging occurred. At the end of 2007, the debt of the Republic of Slovenia amounted to 22 percent of GDP and the net external debt amounted to EUR 6.4 billion. The largest financial inflows came through loans to banks.<span id="ftn220_return"><a class="notelink" title="Bank of Slovenia, Annual Report for 2007, pp. 9-32." href="#ftn220"><sup>212</sup></a></span></p><p id="FromDreams-p-123"><span class="numberParagraph">4</span>The financial crisis that erupted in the United States in 2007 spread throughout the world through national and international banking relations. The first consequences of the crisis were the loss of confidence among banks and the tightening of lending conditions: interbank lending shrank and banks severely curtailed consumer lending. This is how the phenomenon called the credit crunch came about. In many countries, the effects of the credit crunch first manifested in the real estate market, and there were also serious consequences in global banking systems and global economies in general. Richard Sendi believes the financial crisis led to the collapse of large financial institutions and forced governments to take emergency safeguard measures to stop and prevent the worsening of economic recession.<span id="ftn221_return"><a class="notelink" title="Sendi, Richard.

After high economic growth in 2006 and 2007, the latter still stood at 5.6 percent in the first half of 2008. Economic growth in 2008 was 2.8 percentage points higher than the growth of the euro area. Due to the economic situation in the industries related to domestic consumption, employment growth was also high. In 2008, it still averaged 2.2 percent, even 12 percent in construction. Already at the end of 2006, high employment growth led to increased wage growth. For most of 2008, the annual growth rate of average gross wages was around 8.5 percent. The majority of problems occurred in companies due to the declining domestic and foreign demand. At the end of the year, the slowdown in economic activity in industry also began to spread to services and construction. The large decrease in investment demand was mainly due to the slowdown in construction activity. In 2008, for instance, the value added in construction accounted for 9 percent of all value added. Industrial companies were the most affected. In the last two months of 2008, the year-on-year growth rate of exports of goods was -14 percent and of the production in manufacturing -16 percent.<span id="ftn222_return"><a class="notelink" title="Bank of Slovenia, Annual Report for 2008, pp. 7-21." href="#ftn222"><sup>214</sup></a></span> The financial crisis in 2008, especially its reflection in a mistrust and a sharp decline in lending between banks, greatly affected our banks. The former Governor of the Bank of Slovenia, Marko Kranjec, believes that the reason is not “that they had a significant part of investments in securities whose market value was annihilated or almost annihilated, but that our economy is extremely bank-oriented”.<span id="ftn223_return"><a class="notelink" title="Ibid., p. 7." href="#ftn223"><sup>215</sup></a></span> “Companies are almost entirely financed by bank loans, while domestic savings, such as that of households, only partly go into banks. Domestic savings cannot be put into companies in any other way than by banks borrowing from other banks and financial markets abroad. Savings that do not go into banks go abroad through non-bank financial intermediaries and then return by foreign bank borrowing. The economy will not change and become less bank-oriented in order for domestic savings to go directly into our companies and not through foreign countries. The banking and financial system must adapt to this characteristic of the economy”, Kranjec said.<span id="ftn224_return"><a class="notelink" title="Bank of Slovenia, Annual Report for 2008, p. 7." href="#ftn224"><sup>216</sup></a></span> However, given the abundance of cheap money in the world, domestic saving was not the only thing that increased with foreign bank borrowing. Our net external debt also increased. The total gross external debt, which stood at € 15 billion at the end of 2004, that is 56 percent of GDP, rose to 40 billion or 108 percent of GDP in the four years until autumn 2008.<span id="ftn225_return"><a class="notelink" title="Ibid., p. 7." href="#ftn225"><sup>217</sup></a></span> It is interesting to look at household borrowing during this period. In 2008, Slovenian households were still among the least indebted in the EU, despite relatively fast borrowing in the past years. Between 2001 and 2008, the average indebtedness (measured as a share of liabilities in GDP) of an EU Member State increased significantly (the most in Eastern European countries, where the households of some countries, e.g. Latvia and Slovakia, became the most indebted in the EU). The reasons for Slovenia's relatively lower indebtedness could be found in the lower share of housing loans (the latter was among the lowest in the EU - it was lower only in Romania and Bulgaria; in Slovenia, it amounted to 45.9 percent at the end of 2008, while the average share of EU countries was 66 percent), which were repaid over a longer period of time in higher values. After 2004 (the data have been available since then), we also have not seen such a strong increase in loans (the so-called credit boom) as it occurred in the Baltic States for instance. There, the volume of loans increased from 5 to 8 times from 2004 to 2008, while in Slovenia by more than 2 times. In terms of GDP per capita, these countries also lagged further behind the EU average in terms of purchasing power than Slovenia, so their spending was also related to the acquisition of goods that Slovenian households could already afford before.<span id="ftn226_return"><a class="notelink" title="Apohal Vučković, Lidija et al.

The crisis interrupted these favourable trends. The number of employed people decreased and the number of unemployed increased, with the number of recipients of benefits and cash social assistance consequently growing.

The key proposed changes were raising the retirement age, extending the number of years on the basis of which the pension base is calculated, and a new way of aligning pension growth with wage and inflation growth. Among other things, the Act thus provided for raising the retirement conditions for normal retirement to 65 years of age and 15 years of insurance period for both genders or 60 years of age and 43 years of pensionable service without purchased periods for men or 58 years of age and 41 years of pensionable service without purchased periods for women. Early retirement with penalties would be possible at the age of 60 and with 40 years of pensionable service for men and 38 years for women. For more details, see Lorenčič, Aleksander.
